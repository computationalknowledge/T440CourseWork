CSS boxes that Layer and Overlay:
The first box has a class of "box1" and the second box has a class of "box2". The container div has a class of "container" and is set to position: relative. This is important because it allows the child elements (box1 and box2) to be positioned absolutely within the container.
Both boxes are set to position: absolute, which takes them out of the normal flow of the HTML and allows them to overlap. The second box (box2) has a top and left property set to 25px, which positions it 25 pixels from the top and 25 pixels from the left of the container.
You can also change the position property of the boxes to be "fixed" or "sticky" which will keep the boxes in a fixed position as the user scrolls. And also you can play with z-index property to control the stack order of the boxes.
<div class="container">
  <div class="box1">Box 1</div>
  <div class="box2">Box 2</div>
</div>

Your css:

.container {
  position: relative;
}

.box1 {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}

.box2 {
  position: absolute;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: blue;
  top: 25px;
  left: 25px;
}
